## 👋 Introduction
This project is a simple POS (Point of Sale) system developed as part of my semester final project. The backend system is designed using Java with the Spring framework and deployed on Apache Tomcat. It connects to a MySQL database for managing product, order, and customer information. The backend handles business logic, data processing, and API requests from the frontend, which is built with Bootstrap.
Java & Spring Framework: For building RESTful APIs and handling business logic.
Apache Tomcat: For serving the backend application.
MySQL: As the database for storing all system data.
Bootstrap Frontend: Seamlessly integrated with the backend for a smooth user experience.
